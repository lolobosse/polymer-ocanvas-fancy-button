# Polymer Ocanvas FancyButton
A Fancy button I realised for a tutorial (first video there: https://youtu.be/alO2jU0EJhw)

##Story:

My designer wanted a button that she found on Pinterest ([which was pointing there]()) and I decided to implement it althought I got no idea of this [Polymer lib](https://www.polymer-project.org) from Google or what is canvas object in HTML5.
I decided to film me during the process and then to release it on Youtube in order to give beginner advices to beginners!

##What is in there and how does it work?
It's basically a very simple component that you can in your webpage if you load all dependencies it needs.
* Clone the repo
* Install deps via `bower install` ([there](www.bower.io))
* Run with Webserver (see the [video](https://youtu.be/alO2jU0EJhw))

##How can you contribute?
It's kind of a showcase, I may use it in Prod but I do not recommend it if you want to support some old browsers etc... I'd considerate as a playbox and it's really a good way to learn about these revolutionnary canvas objects and some not-that-known frameworks like [oCanvas](http://www.ocanvas.org/) (that I hated at the beginning and finally loved!)
So, you can add other attributes to be customized and one of my whish would be to be closer to the original gif:

So every help to get there would be really nice!
